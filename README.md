<strong> Summary </strong>

Getting the app to only allow the delete button to work when the task was submitted was definitely the biggest challenge. With an if statement
and a button disabler, the logged task was able to be deleted only when it had been crossed through. The same if statement can be 
used to make the buttons more lively by adding a gray color to the delete button and red when it is enabled.
